The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues. This can occur due to several reasons, such as missing spaces around operators, incompatible units, or nesting `calc()` expressions improperly.  For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` is correct, whereas `width:calc(100%-10px)` (missing spaces) is incorrect.  Another common error involves mixing different units within a single `calc()` expression, such as `width:calc(50% - 10em);` where mixing percentage and em units can lead to unpredictable results.  Finally,  incorrect nesting can lead to confusion.  For example, `width:calc(calc(50% - 10px) + 20px);` is redundant and may cause errors.
