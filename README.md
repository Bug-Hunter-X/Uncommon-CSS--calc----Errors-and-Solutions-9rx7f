# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates common and uncommon errors encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function and provides solutions.  The `calc()` function, while powerful, requires careful attention to detail to avoid unexpected layout issues.  Common mistakes include missing spaces between operators and operands, mixing incompatible units within the same expression, and incorrect nesting of `calc()` functions.

**File Structure:**

* `bug.css`: Contains examples of incorrect `calc()` usage.
* `bugSolution.css`: Provides corrected versions of the code in `bug.css`, illustrating how to avoid common mistakes.

This project can be used as a reference to understand and avoid these often subtle CSS pitfalls.
